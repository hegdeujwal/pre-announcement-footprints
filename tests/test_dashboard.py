"""P9 — the dashboard renders, and its binding rules hold.

`UI-context.md` calls its rules binding, and several exist because breaking one
would misrepresent the result rather than merely look untidy: pooling the
scheduled split would let the easy half carry every number, showing plain
accuracy would report over 99% for a system that does nothing, and dropping the
disclaimer would present a footprint as an accusation.

So they are asserted here rather than trusted to review. These tests render
the real app through Streamlit's own harness — if a screen raises, this fails.
