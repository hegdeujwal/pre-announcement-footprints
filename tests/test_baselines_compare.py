"""P5-06 — the comparison table, and the properties that make it a comparison.

A table is only a comparison if every row reached it the same way. These tests
pin that: one evaluation frame, one alert budget, one threshold per baseline
applied across its slices, and the same window count for everyone. If any of
those slipped, two rows could differ because of their harnesses rather than
their detectors, and the whole of Phase 5 would be uninterpretable.
