"""P9-01 — the dashboard shell: routing, masthead, disclaimer.

    .venv/bin/streamlit run app/dashboard.py

A TRIAGE QUEUE, not a prediction display. The user is a compliance analyst —
or an examiner in a viva — deciding in about thirty seconds per row whether
something deserves a closer look. Its job is to make a human faster at
judging, never to make the judgement for them.

Routing lives here so the masthead and the disclaimer wrap every screen. Both
are binding rules in `UI-context.md` (6, 7 and 9), and a screen that forgot one
would present a number without the constraint it was measured against.

Read-only throughout: it opens the database read-only and calls no collector,
so it cannot move the frozen snapshot or spend an API quota.
