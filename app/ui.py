"""Shared UI helpers, and the place `UI-context.md`'s binding rules live.

ON STYLING — a correction, recorded because it was an instructive mistake.

An earlier version of this file hardcoded a light palette: white panels, near
-black headings, fixed greys. It looked acceptable in a light browser and was
close to unreadable in a dark one — the title rendered near-black on a
near-black page, and a wall of white cards glared out of a dark background.
Streamlit follows the viewer's system preference and this project sets no
theme, so roughly half of all viewers got the broken version. The lesson is
narrow and worth keeping: **do not hardcode colour in a themed app.**

So colour is now Streamlit's, entirely. What is left here is a handful of
layout rules — spacing, table density — that hold in either theme, plus the
formatting and rule helpers below. Native components (`st.metric`,
`st.dataframe`, bordered containers) carry the look, which is also what
`UI-context.md` asked for when it said "default theme, no custom CSS".

THE BINDING RULES. Several exist because breaking one would misrepresent a
result rather than merely look untidy, so they are functions here instead of
prose each screen has to remember:

  rule 2  `footprint`, never "insider trading", never an implied person
  rule 5  never plain accuracy; the headline is precision at the alert budget
  rule 6  the budget is on screen, with how much of it is spent
  rule 7  every timestamp carries its timezone AND whether the market was open
  rule 9  the disclaimer is on every screen

#: Severity bands, set from the OBSERVED distribution rather than round
#: numbers. A "3x and above is critical" scale — the first thing tried —
#: labelled every visible row "very strong" and carried no information at all.
#: These edges put roughly the top few per cent, tenth and third of the log in
#: the three upper bands, which is what makes a queue sortable by eye.
#:
#: The edges are deliberately FIXED rather than recomputed per render: a band
#: that moved with the data would relabel yesterday's alert overnight, and an
#: analyst working a queue needs "Strong" to mean the same thing on Tuesday as
#: it did on Monday. `data.strength_distribution` reports where the log
#: currently sits, and the caption on screen quotes it, so the two can be
#: compared — if the distribution drifts far from these edges, that is a signal
#: to revisit them deliberately, not a reason to float them.
_BANDS = [(10.0, "Extreme"), (4.0, "Strong"), (2.0, "Elevated"), (0.0, "Marginal")]

#: Layout only — no colour, so it holds in either theme.
