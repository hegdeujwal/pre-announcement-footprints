"""The number to beat — all four baselines, one evaluation path, one table.

The capstone of Phase 5 and the reason it was built before Phase 6. Without a
tuned baseline, a learned policy that scores 0.09 means nothing: it could be
excellent or it could be losing to a threshold on one column. With this table
it is a comparison.

Every baseline reaches the metrics through the identical route — the P5-01
`predict()` path, the same evaluation population, one alert budget, one
threshold per frame — so any difference between two rows is a difference
between the detectors and not between their harnesses.

Validation only. The test split stays sealed until Phase 10, and
`Baseline.predict` refuses it independently of anything decided here.

Both t0 variants are reported. `t0_utc` is the corrected instant,
min(acceptance, earliest matched news); `t0_filing_utc` is the uncorrected
acceptance time. The gap between the two tables is what the news correction
actually buys, which is the project's headline contribution and therefore has
to be measured rather than asserted.

Usage:
  python -m src.baselines.compare                      # validation, both variants
  python -m src.baselines.compare --variant news_adjusted
  python -m src.baselines.compare --skip-gb            # fast: no model to fit
