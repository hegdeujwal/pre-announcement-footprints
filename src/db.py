"""SQLite storage layer.

Seven tables:

  companies  the study universe, dated at the START of the window so the
             ticker->CIK map is not survivorship-biased (review §7.5).
  filings    raw 8-K rows straight from EDGAR — one row per accession number.
  events     the analysis unit: one usable filing plus its corrected t0,
             materiality and scheduled/unscheduled split.
  bars       yfinance OHLCV, hourly and daily.
  news       headlines with timestamps — this is LABEL infrastructure, not a
             feature source, because t0 = min(acceptance, earliest article).
  meta       key/value provenance, e.g. when the price snapshot was frozen.
  fetch_state per-item collector progress, so an interrupted run resumes.

All timestamps are UTC epoch seconds. All writes are idempotent upserts so
re-running any collector never duplicates rows. Plain sqlite3, no ORM.

`get_conn(path, readonly=True)` opens the file as-is via SQLite's own
`mode=ro` URI, skips schema creation/migration entirely, and raises if the
file does not already exist. Use it for report/audit tools that must never
create or alter the database. Default (`readonly=False`) is unchanged.
