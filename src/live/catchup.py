"""One command, the whole cycle: fetch, scan, log, score, export.

This is what the scheduled job runs. It exists as a single entry point rather
than four so an unattended run has one exit code and one log to read — a
four-step shell pipeline fails in four ways, and three of them are silent.

**It does not need to run continuously.** yfinance serves roughly two years of
hourly history, so a run that happens once a day, or after a gap of a week,
fetches every hour it missed. The alert log records the bar (`ts_utc`) and the
moment the monitor noticed (`raised_utc`) in separate columns, so a catch-up
run is self-describing: nothing is disguised as real-time.

What the evidence is, stated precisely
--------------------------------------
This is **not** live alerting, and the report should not say it is. What it is,
and what actually matters for defending a result: a **pre-registered
out-of-sample test**. The detectors, their tuned thresholds and this code were
committed to git before these bars existed, so there is no route by which they
could have been tuned to them. Git's timestamps make that ordering checkable by
someone who does not trust the author, and the alert log's hash chain makes the
record internally consistent. Neither depends on the monitor having run at any
particular instant.

Usage:
  python -m src.live.catchup                    # the full cycle
  python -m src.live.catchup --max-tickers 300  # stay inside a CI budget
  python -m src.live.catchup --no-fetch         # score what is already stored
