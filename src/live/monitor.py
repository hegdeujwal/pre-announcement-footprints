"""The live monitor — the same detectors, on bars that have not happened yet.

The plan calls this the highest-value, lowest-effort item in the project, and
the reason is that everything else in this repository is retrospective. Every
number so far was measured on data that already existed when the code was
written. This produces the one claim a reader cannot get any other way: *of the
N alerts it raised live, M were followed by a filing within 48 hours.*

**One code path, or the claim is worthless.** The done-when for P7-01 is that
this uses `src/pipeline/features.py` directly. A second implementation of the
features — even a careful one — would drift from the one the detectors were
tuned on, and the live result would then measure the drift rather than the
market. So the live frame is built by `features.ticker_features`, the same
function `build_matrix` and `build_eval_frame` call, and a test asserts the
values agree column for column.

**Every detector runs, not just the winner.** P6-06 found a tuned CUSUM beats
the learned policy, decisively on unscheduled events. Running only CUSUM would
be reasonable; running all of them costs almost nothing extra, because they
score the same frame, and it turns the live period into a forward-looking
replication of the Phase 5/6 comparison rather than a single-detector demo.
When the alert log is scored in P7-03, each detector gets its own hit rate.

**Live data is not the test set.** Bars after the study window were never part
of any split. `split_of` returns `LIVE` for them (fixed here in P7-01 — it
previously returned TEST for everything after `val_end`, unbounded, which would
have had the seal refuse the monitor its own inputs). The sealed period itself
is untouched.

Usage:
  python -m src.live.monitor --dry-run      # one pass, fetch nothing
  python -m src.live.monitor                # fetch latest bars, then score
