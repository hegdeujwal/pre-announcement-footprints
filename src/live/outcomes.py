"""Did anything actually happen? Scoring the live alert log.

This is what turns "the monitor raised 101 alerts" into "of the N alerts it
raised, M were followed by a filing within 48 hours" — the one claim in this
project that is not retrospective.

Three states, not two
---------------------
The obvious implementation asks "was there an 8-K in the next 48 hours?" and
records yes or no. That is wrong, and wrong in the direction that flatters
nothing — it would make the detectors look far worse than they are.

An alert raised two hours before the end of the available filing data has not
been *checked* and found clean; it simply **cannot be answered yet**. Recording
it as a miss counts absence of data as absence of an event. With the live log
as it stands, the newest alerts are hours old and the filing feed ends the same
afternoon, so a naive backfill would score a whole day of alerts as false
positives on no evidence at all.

So an alert is scored only when its **entire** outcome window falls at or
before the filing data horizon. Everything newer is left alone — no outcome
row, so it stays in `unscored()` and is picked up automatically on the next
run. `backfill` reports how many it deferred, so "pending" is visible rather
than silent.

Two clocks, deliberately
------------------------
**The outcome window is wall-clock.** "Was there a filing in the next 48
hours?" is a question about elapsed time: a company can file at any hour,
including overnight and at weekends, and the plan's claim is phrased that way.

**The lead time recorded is in trading hours**, per rule 3, because that is
what every other lead-time figure in this project means and a number that
changed units between the offline table and the live log would be unreadable.

Both are stored. Conflating them would be easy and silent — `decision.
horizon_hours` is 48 in BARS, the outcome window is 48 in wall-clock hours, and
they are different quantities that happen to share a number.

Usage:
  python -m src.live.outcomes                 # score what can be scored
  python -m src.live.outcomes --report        # the hit rate per detector

    `t0_utc` prefers the event row's corrected instant — min(acceptance,
    earliest matched news) — and falls back to raw acceptance when the filing
    has no event row, which is the same fallback `sampling.py` uses.

    The window is measured on that corrected instant, NOT on acceptance time.
    Selecting on acceptance while reporting t0 was a real defect: t0 is
    min(acceptance, earliest news) and so can be up to `news.t0_lookback_hours`
    EARLIER than acceptance, so a filing accepted after the alert could carry a

    `trading_hours_between` raise on a negative lead, aborting the whole
