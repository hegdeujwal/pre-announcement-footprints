"""UTC time and market-hours helpers.

Rule (plan §0.3): all timestamps are stored as UTC epoch seconds; conversion
to anything human-readable happens at display time only. Naive datetimes are
banned — every helper here is timezone-aware.

The market-hours half of this module exists because lead time in this project
is measured in TRADING hours, never wall-clock hours. Most 8-Ks are accepted
after the close, so "the six hours before the filing" is usually the previous
trading session. Answering that correctly needs a real exchange calendar:
holidays move, and the exchange closes early three times a year.
