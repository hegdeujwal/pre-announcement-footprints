"""EDGAR collector — 8-K filings, item codes, and exact acceptance times.

This is the answer key. Every label in the study traces back to one row this
module wrote, so the transport layer is deliberately paranoid: SEC's terms of
service are a descriptive User-Agent with a contact address and no more than
10 requests per second, and the 2026 failure mode everyone hits is an HTTP 200
carrying redirect HTML that parses to nothing while the pipeline reports
success.

`EdgarClient` is cache-first. Every raw response is written under
`paths.edgar_raw` before anything parses it, and a URL already on disk is
served without touching the network — so a repeat run of the full universe
makes zero requests, and a body that turns out not to be JSON is dropped rather
than cached forever.

On top of that sits the universe build (P2-02): SEC's ticker->CIK map,
filtered to the configured exchanges and collapsed to one row per company; and
the per-company submissions fetch (P2-03), which follows SEC's older-filings
pages so a heavy filer's window is not silently truncated; and the 8-K parse
(P2-04), which is where item codes stay strings and acceptance times stay UTC.

Usage:
  python -m src.collectors.edgar --build-universe
