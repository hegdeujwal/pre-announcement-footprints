"""Market data collector — yfinance OHLCV into the `bars` table.

Backtest granularity is hourly ('60m') bars: yfinance serves ~730 days of
those, matching the hourly decision step. Daily bars are supplementary
context, and are what the Phase 3 liquidity filter ranks companies by.
1m/5m/15m/30m bars are NOT used (30-60 day history is useless for backtests).

The hourly window is ROLLING — bars available today silently disappear later —
so coverage must be downloaded broadly and early, then frozen. Broad coverage
(not just event windows) is required because negative sampling and trailing
z-scores both need continuous history. Budget hours of wall-clock time for a
full 6,000-ticker pull, and record the download date with --stamp-snapshot.

Fetches are incremental: each run resumes from the latest cached bar per
(ticker, interval), and every ticker's outcome is recorded in `fetch_state`
so `--resume` continues an interrupted run. All bar timestamps are stored as
UTC epoch seconds of the bar's open.

Usage:
  python -m src.collectors.market --tickers TSLA,AAPL --start 2025-09-01 --end 2026-08-01
  python -m src.collectors.market --candidates --interval 1d --resume
  python -m src.collectors.market --universe              # every liquid ticker + benchmark
  python -m src.collectors.market --universe --stamp-snapshot
  python -m src.collectors.market --candidates --interval 1d --report
